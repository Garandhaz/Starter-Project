Game Title and Concept: The game is called Chords. I wanted to go for a very Wario Ware kind of game that required you to make quick inputs in a short amount of time

Gameplay and mechanics: The mechanics are the keyboard, specifically the Q, W, E, R, T, Y, U, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 keys

Basic Requirements: It does not meet the requirements for a win or lose condition or screen. I understand I will lose points for that.

Audio Requirements: The game has a background 'tune' of a metronome playing. There is one unique sound for each piano key. Had the win and lose condition worked, i would have had sounds for those too. I understand ill lose points for it.

Visual Requirements: The game has a background drawn by hand. The player's keyboard is animated with a particle effect and a ui timer.
